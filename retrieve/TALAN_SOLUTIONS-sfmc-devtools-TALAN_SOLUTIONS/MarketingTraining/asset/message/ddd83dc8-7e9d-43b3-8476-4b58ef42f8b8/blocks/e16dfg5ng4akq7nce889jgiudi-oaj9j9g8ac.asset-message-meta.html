            <h2>Spam</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                While everyone thinks of email when they hear the word &quot;spam,&quot; it fits a
                more broad definition. In addition to the spam messages you get in your email, you
                can also receive spam messages via text, in an instant message and even as comments
                on websites. While not all spam messages are a scam, many spam messages are sent
                with malicious intent.

            <h2>Junk Mail</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Consider the origin of the phrase junk mail: those unsolicited advertisements that
                arrive in a physical mailbox. Your message, while legitimate, may be classified as
                &quot;junk mail&quot; if it doesn't fit their needs. For instance, a teenager may
                delight in the email flyers of a store that sells room decor, while her father finds
                them a nuisance. When you contact your subscribers via email, be sure to include the
                sort of information they actually want and agreed to receive.
